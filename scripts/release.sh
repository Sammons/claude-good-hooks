# Claude Good Hooks - Release Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# OVERVIEW:
# This script initiates the release process for the Claude Good Hooks monorepo
# by creating and pushing a git tag. The actual package building and publishing
# is handled automatically by GitHub Actions.
#
# AUTOMATION WORKFLOW:
# 1. Developer runs this script locally: ./scripts/release.sh 1.2.3
# 2. Script validates environment and creates git tag "v1.2.3"
# 3. Script pushes tag to GitHub repository
# 4. GitHub Actions "Release" workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) triggers
# 5. GitHub Actions handles building, version updating, and npm publishing
#
# GITHUB ACTIONS INTEGRATION:
# - Workflow: .github/workflows/release.yml
# - Trigger: Push of tags matching pattern "v*"
# - Environment: ubuntu-latest with Node.js 20.x and pnpm 10.12.4
# - Required Secrets:
#   - NPM_TOKEN: For publishing packages to npm registry
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN: Automatically provided for creating GitHub releases
#
# EXECUTION CONTEXT:
# - Manual execution: Run locally by developers to initiate releases
# - NOT run by CI/CD: This script runs locally, CI handles the actual release
# - Prerequisites: Clean working directory, main branch, network access
#
# PUBLISHED PACKAGES:
# The GitHub Action publishes these packages to npm:
# - claude-good-hooks-cli
# - claude-good-hooks-types  
# - dirty-hook
# - claude-good-hooks-template-hook
#
# ERROR HANDLING:
# - Validates semver format (x.y.z)
# - Checks for clean working directory
# - Verifies main branch (with override option)
# - Runs tests and build before tagging
# - Provides clear error messages and exit codes
#
# USAGE:
# ./scripts/release.sh <version>
# 
# EXAMPLES:
# ./scripts/release.sh 1.2.3          # Release version 1.2.3
# ./scripts/release.sh 2.0.0-beta.1   # Not supported - only stable releases
#
