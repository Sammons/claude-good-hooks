# Badge Update Workflow
# ===================================================================
#
# This workflow automatically generates and updates repository badges
# that show build status, test coverage, and other metrics. These badges
# are typically displayed in README files to provide quick visual
# indicators of project health.
#
# Triggers:
# - Push to main branch (update badges after code changes)
# - CI workflow completion (update build status badges)
# - Manual trigger (for testing or immediate updates)
#
# Process:
# 1. Run tests to generate fresh coverage data
# 2. Extract coverage percentage from test results
# 3. Determine build status from CI workflow or current push
# 4. Generate badge files using Node.js scripts
# 5. Clean up old/unused badge files
# 6. Commit and push changes back to repository
#
# Badge Types Generated:
# - Build status (passing/failing)
# - Test coverage percentage
# - Package versions
# - Other project metrics as defined in scripts
#
# Security: Only runs on the expected repository to prevent
# unauthorized badge updates in forks.
# ===================================================================
