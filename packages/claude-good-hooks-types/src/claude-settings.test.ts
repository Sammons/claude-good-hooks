 * Claude Settings Tests - Main test file (split into focused test files)
 * 
 * This file serves as the main entry point for Claude Settings tests.
 * Individual test scenarios have been split into focused files for better organization:
 * 
 * - claude-settings.basic-structure.test.ts - Basic settings structure validation
 * - claude-settings.hook-events.test.ts - Individual hook event type configurations
 * - claude-settings.complex-configurations.test.ts - Complex matcher patterns and multiple configurations
 * - claude-settings.real-world-examples.test.ts - Practical configuration examples
 * - claude-settings.type-safety.test.ts - Type safety and validation tests
 * - claude-settings.edge-cases.test.ts - Edge cases and error scenarios

    // This test file has been split into focused test files for better maintainability.
    // Each split file covers specific aspects of the ClaudeSettings interface:
    //
    // 1. Basic Structure - Settings object compliance and hook array validation
    // 2. Hook Event Types - Individual hook event configurations and behaviors
    // 3. Complex Configurations - Multiple configurations, regex matchers, wildcards
    // 4. Real-world Examples - Practical configurations for development, security, CI/CD
    // 5. Type Safety - TypeScript type enforcement and validation
    // 6. Edge Cases - Unusual scenarios and error handling
    //
    // All tests maintain the same coverage but are now organized by feature area.
