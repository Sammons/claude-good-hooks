 * Hook Configuration Tests - Main test file (split into focused test files)
 * 
 * This file serves as the main entry point for Hook Configuration tests.
 * Individual test scenarios have been split into focused files for better organization:
 * 
 * - hook-configuration.core-structure.test.ts - Core structure and required fields
 * - hook-configuration.matcher-patterns.test.ts - Matcher pattern variations
 * - hook-configuration.hooks-array.test.ts - Hooks array variations and ordering
 * - hook-configuration.command-variations.test.ts - Different types of commands
 * - hook-configuration.timeout-configurations.test.ts - Timeout value handling
 * - hook-configuration.real-world-use-cases.test.ts - Practical real-world examples
 * - hook-configuration.edge-cases.test.ts - Edge cases and validation scenarios

    // This test file has been split into focused test files for better maintainability.
    // Each split file covers specific aspects of the HookConfiguration interface:
    //
    // 1. Core Structure - Basic interface compliance and required fields
    // 2. Matcher Patterns - Tool matching patterns including regex and wildcards
    // 3. Hooks Array - Hook command arrays, ordering, and variations
    // 4. Command Variations - Simple, complex, and environment-aware commands
    // 5. Timeout Configurations - Timeout values and edge cases
    // 6. Real-world Use Cases - Practical examples for formatting, testing, git, etc.
    // 7. Edge Cases - Special characters, unicode, and extreme values
    //
    // All tests maintain the same coverage but are now organized by feature area.
